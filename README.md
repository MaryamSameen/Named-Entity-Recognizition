# Named-Entity-Recognizition
This project demonstrates how to use spaCy for Named Entity Recognition (NER) with a pre-trained model and how to manually adjust entity labels if necessary.

Overview
This script utilizes spaCy's pre-trained en_core_web_sm model to perform named entity recognition on a given text. It then stores unique entities and their labels in a dictionary. Additionally, it shows how to manually adjust entity labels if needed.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
spaCy library

Description
Load the Pre-trained Model: The script loads the en_core_web_sm model from spaCy.
Process the Text: The text is processed to extract named entities.
Store Unique Entities: Entities are stored in a dictionary with their labels.
Adjust Labels: Optionally adjust labels for specific entities if needed.
Print Results: The script prints the unique entities and their labels.

Notes
The pre-trained spaCy model recognizes a set of standard entity labels. If you need specific entity recognition, you can manually adjust labels as shown in the script.
Entity label adjustments are optional and should be made based on your specific requirements.
